# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

Submitted by: **Hung Nguyen**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] The keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. (I want user to be able to see the whole main page)
* [ ] Remember the bill amount across app restarts. (If you return 10 minutes later, it defaults to blank.)
* [ ] Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separator.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [x] Main page - Select Your Venue: there are some default venues. Each venue has three different tip percentage values.
- [x] Main page - Rate Your Service: decide tip percentage value (which is pre-defined, by each venue) by selecting emotion icons.
- [x] Main page - Tip Percentage: user can also customize value for selected emotion icon, if prefer.
- [x] Main page - No. of People: split bill feature. Friends can easily know their payments.
- [x] Main page - Renew: bring everything back to default.
- [x] Settings page: User can change three default tip percentage values for each venue, depending on preference.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I didn't have time to add more features. Started implementing immediately after knowing about the course, just near the deadline.
I'll improve it later.
- Inspired by some apps on iTunes.
